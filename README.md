## ðŸ§¾ Code Overview

### 1. PayPal SDK Script

```html
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&components=buttons,funding-eligibility&currency=USD&enable-funding=card"></script>
````

* Loads PayPal SDK with support for PayPal + Card payments.
* `client-id` should be replaced with your Live or Sandbox ID.

---

### 2. Amount Input

```html
<input type="text" id="amount" placeholder="000.00" inputmode="numeric" oninput="formatCurrency(this)" maxlength="9">
```

* Accepts only numeric input.
* Automatically formats input into currency (`000.00`) as the user types.

---

### 3. formatCurrency() Function

```js
function formatCurrency(input) {
  const cleaned = input.value.replace(/\D/g, '');
  const number = parseInt(cleaned || '0', 10);
  const formatted = (number / 100).toFixed(2);
  input.value = formatted.padStart(6, '0');
}
```

* Removes all non-digits.
* Pads input with zeros.
* Divides by 100 to simulate cents.
* Ensures output like `005.75`, `000.99`, etc.

---

### 4. PayPal Buttons (Two Render Calls)

```js
paypal.Buttons({...}).render('#paypal-button-container');
```

* Rendered twice: one for `PayPal`, one for `Card`.
* `createOrder`: pulls amount from the formatted input.
* `onApprove`: shows a thank-you alert with payer's first name.
